# Product Idea
An application that displays the body and facial expressions that most accurately express or convey a given emotion or behavior. When experiencing strong emotions, a person loses a real sense of how to look right. By entering the situation, the application finds the most appropriate way for the person to look based on the given situation, showing the position of the body and facial expression. When recording such programs, the program calculates the percentage of expression of a given emotion and behavior and determines a suitable environment or situation for them.
